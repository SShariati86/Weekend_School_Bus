Utilizing government owned school buses as charter buses when not in use for their primary purpose. 

Using the California State Fleet data provided, I have identified a total of 196 school buses that are owned by the State of California which can be used to charter people as an extra source of revenue for the government. These buses would charter people when they are not being used for their primary purpose.

-44 School Buses within Prison Industry Authority
-80 School Buses within Deparment of Corrections and Rehabilitation
